# One_Note_User_sign_in
Python Script that logs user out of one note and forces a sync. 

This script uses the sync and sign_out/sign_in methods of the OneDriveClient and OnenoteClient classes to synchronize the user's OneDrive folders and OneNote notes, and sign them out and then back in to OneDrive and OneNote.
